[Description (single paragraph)]
As part of the OHDSI APAC Symposium 2012, the APAC Community selected 4 studies to push into 2022. The CHATPER study is one of them. This study will assess the incidence, prevalence, and treatment pattern of diseases or healthcare utilization during pre- and post-COVID 19 era. By this we aim to identify the temporal causality between COVID-19 and epidemiogical changes in health across OHDSI, especially APAC region.
